A very basic demo of CUDA enabled Hough Transform.

To run:

`python3 bubbles.py`

To install OpenCV with CUDA support on Ubuntu or Debian, copy `install.sh` to somewhere you're okay with putting build files, and then run and enter information when prompted. Most OpenCV packages (apt, pip, conda, etc.) aren't kept up to date and don't have CUDA support out of the box, so you can use this script to build it and install it.
